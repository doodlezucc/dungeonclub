            <li>Security measures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do we protect your data?</h3>
        <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR, taking
            into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, circumstances and
            purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and
            freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by
            controlling physical access to the data, as well as access to, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and
            segregation of the data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights,
            deletion of data and response to data compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account during the development and selection of
            hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology
            design and through data protection-friendly default settings (Art. 25 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            Your data is protected against unauthorised access and loss by a variety of electronic, technical,
            contractual and administrative measures. We use security techniques (e.g. SSL encryption, cryptographic
            procedures) to protect your data against access by unauthorised third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Is your data passed on to third parties?</h3>
        <p>
            If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to other persons and companies, transmit it to them or
            otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of a legal permission, e.g. if
            a transmission of the data to third parties, such as to service providers, is necessary for the performance
            of the contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this
            or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.). Our server is
            provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/?nc1=f_pr">Amazon Web Services</a> and located in
            Frankfurt, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to be able to offer you our service in the best possible way, we use, among others, service
            providers who work on our behalf. If this is the case, corresponding agreements on commissioned processing
            pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR have been concluded with the service providers.
        </p>

        <h3>Shared with your consent or at your direction</h3>
        <p>
            If you consent or ask us to, we will share your information (campaign invite, name, nickname, email address,
            profile picture) as described at the time of consent with the user you are inviting to participate in your
            D&D Interactive campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, when you message other users during your Campaign as a part of the Campaign you are playing and
            using our messaging service. This includes profile, name, names of any other guests and your message), and
            any other information you submit and they agree to share.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you, as a Dungeon Master, invite another user to assist you, you authorise that person to access and if
            necessary, update your information and content, including but not limited to certain information such as
            your name, nick name, and messages.
        </p>

        <h3>Transfers to third countries</h3>
        <p>
            If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area
            (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services this will only occur if it is
            necessary for the fulfilment of our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a
            legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions,
            we only process data or have data processed in a third country if the special requirements of Art. 44 et
            seq. GDPR are met. This means, for example, that the processing is carried out on the basis of special
            guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a level of data protection corresponding to
            the EU or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (so-called "standard
            contractual clauses").
        </p>

        <p>
            The data we process will be deleted or its processing restricted in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 of
            the GDPR. Unless expressly stated within the scope of this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be
            deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with
            any statutory retention obligations or justified interests. A justified interest exists, for example, with
            regard to the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or to prevent cases of fraud, i.e. for your
            protection. If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes,
            its processing will be restricted. I.e. the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes.

            respective user action. The storage is mandatory and is carried out to protect the user from misuse or
            unauthorised use by other users, as well as on the basis of our legitimate interests. As a matter of
            principle, this data is not passed on to third parties unless it is necessary for the pursuit of our claims
            or there is a legal obligation to do so pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR.
        </p>
